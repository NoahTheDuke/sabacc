# Kessel Sabacc

I like Kessel Sabacc in Star Wars Outlaws that I decided to make it myself. I've been
trying to learn Ocaml, so why not use it here?


Here is an article to give proper information about the inspiration for the game, how to play it, and a visual interpretation of the game [Kessel Sabacc](https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-outlaws/Kessel_Sabacc_-_How_to_Play_and_Rewards).
